# liri-node-app

## For this class we dove into LIRI. Liri is an interpretation and recognition interface as [described here](https://liri.io)

### We used the following technologies" 
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/www.nodejs.com)
* [Axios](https://www.axios.com)
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)
* [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com)
* and finally [bandsintown](https://www.bandsintown.com/en)


### I built a command line app using node.js which gives us the ability to find songs, bands and movies. We used the following sources: 


* [Spotify](www.spotify.com)
* [OMDB](www.omdb.com)
* [bandsintown](https://www.bandsintown.com/en)

### I created API keys for each service and then did the following: 

* created keys.env
* created liri.js
* created keys.js

### Then I needed to do the following: 

* create package-lock.json
* create package.json
* create random.txt
* create README.md (which you're reading)

### Then finally I needed to do the following: 

* create a .gitignore to prevent Github from publishing my API keys
